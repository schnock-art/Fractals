# Fractals
### In this Repository I will be uploading all the fractals I make using C# and Unity.
### Feel free to use them in your projects.

## CubePoolManager
For more efficient Object handling a CubeObjectPool is created. You will need to create an Empty Object and attach the CubePoolManager script to it. Then you can change the parameters in the inspector to get the desired result. Do not forget to reference the Script in the correspoding fractal

## Menger Sponge

Under Scripts/MengerSponge.cs you will find the code for the Menger Sponge fractal. The code is pretty simple and easy to understand. The only thing you need to do is to create a cube and attach the script to it. Then you can change the parameters in the inspector to get the desired result.
